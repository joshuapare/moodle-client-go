## Methods

### NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest

`func NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest(competencyidfrom int32, competencyidto int32, planid int32, ) *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest`

NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest instantiates a new CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequestWithDefaults

`func NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequestWithDefaults() *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest`

NewCoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequestWithDefaults instantiates a new CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetCompetencyidfrom

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetCompetencyidfrom() int32`

GetCompetencyidfrom returns the Competencyidfrom field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetCompetencyidfromOk

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetCompetencyidfromOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetCompetencyidfromOk returns a tuple with the Competencyidfrom field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetCompetencyidfrom

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) SetCompetencyidfrom(v int32)`

SetCompetencyidfrom sets Competencyidfrom field to given value.


### GetCompetencyidto

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetCompetencyidto() int32`

GetCompetencyidto returns the Competencyidto field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetCompetencyidtoOk

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetCompetencyidtoOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetCompetencyidtoOk returns a tuple with the Competencyidto field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetCompetencyidto

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) SetCompetencyidto(v int32)`

SetCompetencyidto sets Competencyidto field to given value.


### GetPlanid

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetPlanid() int32`

GetPlanid returns the Planid field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetPlanidOk

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) GetPlanidOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetPlanidOk returns a tuple with the Planid field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetPlanid

`func (o *CoreCompetencyReorderPlanCompetencyRequest) SetPlanid(v int32)`

SetPlanid sets Planid field to given value.
